# Shortz (Flutter) — MVP Starter

This repository is a **code-first MVP starter** for a short-video sharing app (TikTok-like) named **Shortz**.

✅ Cross-platform UI (Android/iOS)  
✅ Dark mode by default  
✅ TikTok-style bottom navigation + vertical feed  
✅ Clean architecture-ish folders (models / services / screens)  
✅ Firebase-ready (Auth + Firestore + Storage) with placeholders

> Important: this ZIP includes the Flutter source + structure, but because this environment cannot run `flutter create`,
> you should generate the platform folders on your machine (Android/iOS) once, then run.

---

## 1) Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed
- Android Studio + Android SDK
- Xcode (for iOS on macOS)

---

## 2) Bootstrap (creates Android/iOS folders if missing)

From the project root:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This will:
- run `flutter create .` if needed
- fetch packages

---

## 3) Firebase setup

This project expects Firebase for:
- Phone OTP auth
- Email/password or email-link login (you can pick)
- Firestore (data)
- Storage (videos, thumbnails)

### Steps
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Add Android + iOS apps
3. Install FlutterFire CLI and configure:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

4. Replace the placeholder file:
- `lib/firebase/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire)

Then:

```bash
flutter run
```

## 4) What’s implemented vs. stubbed

Implemented:
- App shell + navigation
- Home vertical feed (mock data)
- Friends feed (mock)
- Messages (mock chat list + chat screen UI)
- Profile (mock, edit profile UI shell)
- Reusable widgets + simple state handling

Stubbed (TODO):
- Real video upload + compression/transcoding
- Real feed query + pagination
- Likes/comments/follows persistence
- Real chat persistence + presence
- Search implementation backed by Firestore indexes

---

## 5) Folder structure

```
lib/
  app.dart
  main.dart
  core/
    theme/
    utils/
  features/
    auth/
    feed/
    profile/
    messages/
    create/
  firebase/
    firebase_bootstrap.dart
    firebase_options_placeholder.dart
  models/
  services/
  widgets/
scripts/
  bootstrap.sh
```

---

## 6) Notes for your MVP

- Start with email login if phone OTP costs become annoying.
- For videos: store in Firebase Storage + store metadata in Firestore.
- Use Cloud Functions later for thumbnail generation & moderation.
